# EXPLANATION OF Notes API

This is a RESTful API built with FastAPI for managing notes. Users can create, read, update, and delete notes, as well as share notes with other users and search for notes based on keywords.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/signup`: Create a new user account.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in to an existing user account and receive an access token.

### Note Endpoints
- `GET /api/notes`: Get a list of all notes for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/notes/{id}`: Get a note by ID for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/notes`: Create a new note for the authenticated user.
- `PUT /api/notes/{id}`: Update an existing note by ID for the authenticated user.
- `DELETE /api/notes/{id}`: Delete a note by ID for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/notes/{id}/share`: Share a note with another user for the authenticated user.
- `GET /api/search?q={query}`: Search for notes based on keywords for the authenticated user.

## Database Choice

We chose MongoDB as the database for this project due to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use with FastAPI. MongoDB's document-based model allows for storing notes as JSON-like documents, making it suitable for this application.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
   cd notes-api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up the database (if using MongoDB):
- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
- Update the connection string in `database.py` if necessary.

4. Run the FastAPI application:
5. Access the API at http://localhost:8000.

## Running Tests
